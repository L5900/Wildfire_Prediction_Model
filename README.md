# Wildfire Prediction in Italy

This project uses machine learning to predict wildfires in Italy based on spatial and temporal data.

## Project Structure

- **4_minimal_model.ipynb**: Builds and evaluates predictive models using an enriched dataset.
- **visualisations.ipynb**: Contains visual exploration of wildfire data.
- **training_base_enriched_power.csv**: Dataset used for training and evaluation.

## Goals

- Understand the spatial and temporal patterns of wildfires.
- Build predictive models to estimate wildfire occurrence.
- Present insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## Getting Started

To run the notebooks:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_NAME

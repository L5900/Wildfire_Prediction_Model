# 🔥 Wildfire Prediction in Italy

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict wildfires in Italy based on spatial, temporal, and environmental variables. It forms part of a broader investigation into how data science can inform climate resilience and disaster response.

## 📁 Project Overview

- `4_minimal_model.ipynb`: Develops and evaluates predictive models using an enriched dataset.
- `visualisations.ipynb`: Includes visual analysis of wildfire patterns.
- `training_base_enriched_power.csv`: The dataset used for model training and validation.

## 🎯 Objective

To identify patterns and predictors of wildfire occurrence in Italy and evaluate the performance of simple predictive models. This work supports interdisciplinary research at the intersection of political science, statistics, and environmental risk analysis.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
   ```

2. Open the notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Install dependencies (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## 🧠 Motivation

> 🌍 **Why Wildfire Prediction in Italy?**
>
> Southern Europe faces increasing wildfire risks due to climate change and land use dynamics. This project uses data to move from retrospective analysis to predictive insight — supporting early intervention strategies and policymaking. It also contributes to the PaCE initiative’s focus on spatial and temporal modeling of conflict and crisis data.

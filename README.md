# Wildfire Risk Prediction in Italy

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict wildfires in Italy based on spatial, temporal, and environmental variables. I built three toy models that predict wildfire risk in Italy, trying to understand what is the minimal amount of features needed to obtain reasonable prediction at low computational cost. The data is taken from NASA open source satellites, and I found it a good excercise to gain familiarity with sci-kit learn, as well as to learn handling very unstructured data.

## Disclaimer 1:## I used generative AI to help me with many parts of the code

## Project Overview

- `Description`: Is a 4-slides presentation describing the dataset and the metrics and results of the models, together with visualisations;
- `4_minimal_model.ipynb`: Develops and evaluates predictive models using an enriched dataset.
- `visualisations.ipynb`: Includes visual analysis of wildfire patterns.
- `training_base_enriched_power.csv`: The dataset used for model training and validation.
